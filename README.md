# Parameter-Estimation-and-Joint-Confidence-Regions-for-Generalized-Lindley-Distribution

*Abstarct:*

We deal with the problem of estimating the parameters of the generalized Lindley distribution. Besides the classical estimator, inverse moment and modified inverse estimators are proposed and their properties are investigated. A condition for the existence and uniqueness of the inverse moment and modified inverse estimators of the parameters is established. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to compare the estimatorsâ€™ performances. Two methods for constructing joint confidence regions for the two parameters are also proposed and their performances are discussed. A real example is presented to illustrate the proposed methods.
